# SLAM + Navigation simulation for mobile robot

**Goal -->** Through this project, I build a ROS 2 simulation for a mobile robot. The program is written, tested and simulated for ROS 2 - Foxy Fitzroy. The simulation aims to complete 3 main tasks:

1. To build a robust package that can spawn a robot in a simulation world of our selection.
2. To use slam toolbox to perform SLAM in an explored environment to build an acurate 2D representation of a Gazebo World.
3. To use ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav 2) to move the mobile robot around the map autonomously

## Background

Nav2, the ROS2 Navigation Stack, is a collection of software packages that allows a mobile robot to move from a starting location to a goal location autonomously, without colliding with obstacles in the way.

The Slam Toolbox package incorporates information from laser scanners in the form of a LaserScan message and TF transforms from odom->base link, and creates a 2D map. This package will allow you to fully serialize the data and pose-graph of the SLAM map to be reloaded to continue mapping, localize, merge, etc.

## System Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS2 - Foxy Fitzroy Distribution
- Gazebo
- Rviz2
